Hi!

Welcome to my portfolio repository. 

At the moment there's a few different projects in here. 

- Please see my bachelor's thesis repository for my latest work: github.com/jim-anderssen/oxide-model-prediction

- File handling scripts is the directory for my server management scripts.

- analysis_project is my indoor climate analysis. 

- Some of my university projects are in the directory 'Older work', such as a wind power assessment, where all the analysis was done in python.

Thank you for looking through my portfolio and feel free to get in touch.
