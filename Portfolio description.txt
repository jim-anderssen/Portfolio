Hi!

Welcome to my github portfolio repository. 

At the moment there's 2 different projects in here.

The main one is my data analysis project of which you'll find more information about in the analysis_project directory.

The other file is my solar power analysis project conducted at my university last spring, as part of a scientific writing course. It has pretty basic methodology, but nevertheless the research beforehand was pretty thorough and extensive and I'm quite pleased with the report.


I will be appending more projects to this portfolio as I continue in my studies. Thank you for looking thorugh my portfolio and feel free to get in touch.
